# RNA Extractions of 7 Pentagona With the [Zymo DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/quick-dna-rna-kits/products/quick-dna-rna-miniprep-plus-kit)

### Notes

- Using the [Zymo DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/quick-dna-rna-kits/products/quick-dna-rna-miniprep-plus-kit)
- Used 1.4mm ceramic beads and the tissuelyser for 2 minutes at 25Hz, stopped at 30 seconds and moved the tubes to the other side of the sample holder in the lyser.
- Incubated at room temp with the proteinase K for 15 minutes shaking at 550rpm
## Sample Preparation

- Samples:
  - CPAB2 003
  - CPAB2 008
  - CPDB 002
  - CPDB 009
  - CPAB 005
  - CPBO 002
  - CPBO 006
- Thawed samples on ice bucket
- Prepared forceps, foil, and razor blades
- Cleaned forceps with 10% bleach, DI water, 70% ethanol, and RNaseZap before and between each sample
- Made 1 ceramic bead tube with 700ul DNA/RNA shield for each tissuelyser sample
- Cut a small piece of tissue for each sample then minced with the razor blade until it was flat and could come apart a little bit and placed in their respective bead homogenization tube
- Ran the tissuelyser for 2 minutes at 25Hz
- Spun down the bead tubes in the minifuge to remove bubbles
- Added 70ul proteinase K digestion buffer and 35ul proteinase K to each bead tube
- Briefly vortexed and spun down sample tubes
- Placed in the thermomixer for 15 minutes shaking at 550rpm at 23 degrees C temp (room temp)

- Centrifuged 16,000rcf for 30 seconds
- Added another 50ul warmed 10mM Tris HCl to the spin columns gently by dripping over the filter
- Incubated at room temp for 5 minutes
- Centrifuged 16,000rcf for 30 seconds
- Discarded the spin columns
- Made strip tubes with 7ul of each sample in them for QC
- Kept tubes on ice bucket then stored in -20 degree freezer

#### RNA TapeStation

- Followed [RNA tapestation protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/RNA-TapeStation-Protocol/)
- [TapeStation Report link](https://github.com/meschedl/MES_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/tapetstations/2020-11-24%20-%2016.45.47.pdf)
- I decided not to tapestation CPAB 008 even though there was probably some RNA in there, I didn't want to waste the space on the screentape. I will have to extract one more sample from CPAB2 and then I will have finished with the RNA
