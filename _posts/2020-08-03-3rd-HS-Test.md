# 3 More DNA Extraction Tests on Horseshoe Crab Samples from Natalie, Tying Much Smaller Sample Pieces

Samples: 797, 822, and 887
[Extraction kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/quick-dna-kits/products/quick-dna-miniprep-plus-kit)

**Sample Prep and Incubation**

- Thawed samples on ice
- Made 31.5mL tubes with 800ul of DNA/RNA Shield
- 10% bleach, DI and ETOH forceps and scalpel
- Placed new foil down for each tissue
- Cut **very** small pieces of tissue, 1-2cm2, and minced until flat, avoided all cuticle/exoskeleton

797

822

887

- Added tissue to the 1.5mL tubes with 300ul of DNA/RNA shield, one for each piece
- Added 150ul of solid tissue buffer to each tube (blue)
- Added 15ul proteinase K to each tube
- Vortexed each tube for 10 seconds
- Spun the tubes down quickly in the minifuge

887

- Placed sample tubes in the thermomixer at 55 degrees C shaking at 1200rpm at 9am
- After 1 hour they looked pretty well digested, let go for 1 more hour though

**DNA Extraction**

- After incubation, centrifuged tubes at 1300 rcf for 1 min to pellet and insoluble debris
- Took off supernatant (~450ul) and put into new 1.5mL tubes (pellet small but visible)
- Added equal volume (450ul) DNA binding buffer to each tube
- Vortexed and spun down tubes
- Set up 1 spin column and collection tube per sample
- Warmed 10mM Tris HCl to 70 degrees C in the thermomixer
- Added 700ul of each sample to their labeled spin columns
- Centrifuged at 1300 rcf for 1 min
- Discarded flow through
- Added the rest of the liquid to the spin columns and centrifuged in the same way
- Transferred columns to new collection tubes
- Added 400ul DNA pre-wash buffer to each column
- Centrifuged 1300 rcf for 1 minute and discarded flow through
- Added 700ul DNA wash buffer to each column
- Centrifuged 1300 rcf for 1 minute and discarded flow through
- Added 400ul DNA wash buffer to each column
- Centrifuged 1300 rcf for 1 minute and discarded flow through
- Made 1.5mL tubes labeled completely with sample names and information
- Transferred spin columns to those 1.5mL tubes
- Added 50ul of warmed 10mM tris HCl by dripping to each spin column filter
- Incubated columns for 5 minutes
- Centrifuged columns for 1 min at 1300 rcf
- Repeated last 3 steps once
- Placed tubes on ice afterwards

**Qubit**

- Broad range dsDNA qubit ([protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MES_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/2019-03-02/Qubit-Protocol))
- Amounts are in ng/ul and samples were read twice

|Sample|Reading 1|Reading 2| Average DNA (ng/ul)|
|---|---|---|---|
|standard 1|178|-|-|
|standard 2|19690|-|-|
|797|37.6|37|37.3|
|822|24.6|24.6|24.6|
|887|36.4|36|36.2|

**Gel**

- Small 1% Agarose Gel ([protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MES_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/2019-03-01/PPP-Lab-Gel-Protocol))
- [Ladder](https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FMAN0013047_GeneRuler_1kb_Plus_DNALadder_250ug_UG.pdf&title=VXNlciBHdWlkZTogR2VuZVJ1bGVyIDEga2IgUGx1cyBETkEgTGFkZGVy)

**Also a TapeStation**

- A Genomic DNA screentape was run [protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/DNA-Tapestation/)
- [Link to report](https://github.com/meschedl/MES_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/tapetstations/2020-08-04.pdf)

TapeStation report showed less "smear" or lighting up around the DNA. Looks pretty good high molecular weight DNA! This extraction protocol works well. I emailed Dr. Heather Bracken-Grissom and her lab (works on regular crabs) soaks the tissue in PBS (phosphate buffered saline) before extraction, a few minutes to a few hours. I might try that.
