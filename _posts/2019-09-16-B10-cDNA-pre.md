# Stranded mRNA Library Prep for CASE EecSeq Block 10

Following half reactions from the [KAPA Biosystems Stranded mRNA-Seq Kit](https://www.kapabiosystems.com/product-applications/products/next-generation-sequencing-2/rna-library-preparation-2/kapa-stranded-mrna-seq-kits/#accordion-order), also see the [EeqSeq protocol](https://github.com/jpuritz/EecSeq/blob/master/Protocol.md#stranded-mrna-seq-library-prep)

3. Removed supernatant
4. Added 315μl of bead binding buffer and pipetted to mix off magnet
5. Put back on magnet and removed as much supernatant as possible
6. Added 315μl of bead binding buffer again and pipetted to mix off magnet
7. Put back on magnet and again removed as much supernatant as possible
8. Added 315μl of bead binding buffer and pipetted to mix off magnet
9. Prepared RNA samples: 1μg in 25μl with the rest made up with nuclease free water
