# DNA/RNA Extractions on 3 Sea Star Tissue Samples Stored in DNA/RNA Shield, 3 Pentagona and 1 Hystera, 2 Samples With Dremel Homogenization, 2 With Tissuelyser


### Notes

- Using the [Zymo DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/quick-dna-rna-kits/products/quick-dna-rna-miniprep-plus-kit)
- Used Dremel with drill bit head for 20 seconds at lowest power setting (5) on the first two samples
- Used 1.4mm ceramic beads and the tissuelyser for 2 minutes at 25Hz for the second two samples
- No incubation, no proteinase K

## Sample Preparation

- Samples:
  - CPAB2-001 _dremel_
  - CHSY-005 _dremel_
  - CPAB-006 _tissue lyser_
  - CPBP-002 _tissue lyser_
- Thawed samples on ice bucket
- Prepared forceps, foil, and razor blades
- Cleaned forceps with 10% bleach, DI water, 70% ethanol, and RNaseZap before and between each sample
- Cleaned dremel bit by bathing in beach, DI and ethanol, RNaseZap and touching only with forceps between each sample
- Made 1 1.5mL tube per sample with 300ul of DNA/RNA shield for each dremel sample
- Made 1 ceramic bead tube with 500ul DNA/RNA shield for each tissue lyser sample
- Cut a small piece of tissue for each sample then minced with the razor blade until it was flat and could come apart a little bit and placed in their respective homogenization tube
- CPAB2-001 tissue piece and minced piece

![2]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CPAB2-001-2.jpeg "2")
- CHSY-005 tissue piece and minced piece
![3]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CHSY-005-1.jpeg "3")
![4]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CHSY-005-2.jpeg "4")
- CPAB-006 tissue piece and minced piece
![5]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CPAB-006-1.jpeg "5")
![6]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CPAB-006-2.jpeg "6")
- CPBP-002 tissue piece and minced piece
![5]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CPBP-002-1.jpeg "5")
![6]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CPBP-002-2.jpeg "6")
- Dremel homogenized the first two samples (cleaning bit in between) for 20 seconds on 5 speed
- Before homogenization with the dremel:

- After homogenization with the dremel:
![8]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/DREMEL-AFTER.jpeg "8")
- Put the bead tubes in the TissueLyser for 2 minutes at 25Hz (balenced with empty bead tubes)
- After TissueLyser homogenization:
![9]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/LYSER-AFTER.jpeg "9")
- Spun down the bead tubes in the minifuge to remove bubbles
- Centrifuged the dremel-homogenized tubes in the centrifuge at max speed for 2 min to pellet debris
- Still some floating debris in the dremel-tubes after centrifugation, like the previous dremel extraction:
![10]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/FLOATING.jpeg "10")
- Avoided all debris and pipetted supernatnat from each tube into each a new 1.5mL tube
- Added equal volume DNA/RNA lysis buffer to each tube (300ul for dremel tubes, 450ul for tissue lyser tubes)

### DNA Extraction

#### RNA TapeStation

- Followed [RNA tapestation protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/RNA-TapeStation-Protocol/)
- [TapeStation Report link](https://github.com/meschedl/MES_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/tapetstations/2020-11-05%20-%2013.57.43.pdf)

#### Notes

RNA quality is really good, just yield is low. DNA quality looks similar between the two methods.
