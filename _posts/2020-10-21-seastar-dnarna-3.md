# DNA/RNA Extractions on 3 Sea Star Tissue Samples Stored in DNA/RNA Shield, 2 Pentagona and 1 Hystera

### Notes

- Using the [Zymo DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/quick-dna-rna-kits/products/quick-dna-rna-miniprep-plus-kit)
- Using ceramic beads
- Using the tissuelyser instead of the vortexer. Manual says different things for DNA and RNA settings so I went in the middle. It says 15 Hz for 30 seconds for DNA, and 2 min at 20-30 Hz for RNA. So I decided to try 1 minute at 15 Hz.
- Increased incubation time to 2 hours

## Sample Preparation

- Samples:
  - CPBP-006
  - CPDP-003
  - CHSY-002
- Thawed samples on ice bucket
- Prepared forceps, foil, and razor blades
- Cleaned forceps with 10% bleach, DI water, 70% ethanol, and RNaseZap before and between each sample
- Made 1 bead tube per sample with 500ul of DNA/RNA shield in each
- Cut a small piece of tissue for each sample then minced with the razor blade until it was flat and could come apart a little bit
- CPBP-006 tissue piece and minced piece

![2]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CPBP-006-2.jpeg "2")
- CPDP-003 tissue piece and minced piece
![3]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CPDP-003-1.jpeg "3")
![4]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CPDP-003-2.jpeg "4")
- CHSY-002 tissue piece and minced piece
![5]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CHSY-002-1.jpeg "5")
![6]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CHSY-002-2.jpeg "6")
- Put bead tubes in the tissuelyser for 1 minute at 15Hz
- Samples were not as broken up as I thought they would be
- Spun down tubes to get rid of bubbles
- Added 50ul ProK digestion buffer and 25ul of Proteinase K to each bead tube
- Vortexed and spun down samples
- CPBP-006, CPDP-003, and CHSY-002 in order post homogenization and digestion liquid addition:
![7]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/post-homog.jpeg "7")
- Placed all bead tubes in the thermomixer at 55 degrees C shaking 300rpm for 2 hours
- Tubes looked better after digestion:
- CPBP-006
![8]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CPBP-006-3.jpeg "8")
- CPDP-003
![9]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CPDP-003-3.jpeg "9")
- CHSY-002
![10]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CHSY-002-3.jpeg "10")
- Removed all the liquid from the bead tubes into new 1.5mL tubes (~450ul)

### DNA Extraction

- Saved the flow through in the 5mL tubes

- Transferred spin columns to new 1.5mL tubes for each sample labeled as final DNA tubes
- Discarded flow through and collection tubes
- Added 50ul warmed 10mM Tris HCl to the spin columns gently by dripping over the filter

#### Notes

- The RNA is degraded on the only sample where I got any, I don't know what happened
