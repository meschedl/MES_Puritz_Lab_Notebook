# RNA Extractions of 2 Pentagona With the [Zymo DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/quick-dna-rna-kits/products/quick-dna-rna-miniprep-plus-kit), doing 2 CPAB2 Samples Because They Have Been So Tough to Get Enough RNA

### Notes

- Using the [Zymo DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/quick-dna-rna-kits/products/quick-dna-rna-miniprep-plus-kit)
- Used 1.4mm ceramic beads and the tissuelyser for 2 minutes at 25Hz, stopped at 30 seconds and moved the tubes to the other side of the sample holder in the lyser.
- Incubated at room temp with the proteinase K for 15 minutes shaking at 550rpm

## Sample Preparation

- Samples:
  - CPAB2 010
  - CPAB2 005
- Thawed samples on ice bucket
- Prepared forceps, foil, and razor blades
- Cleaned forceps with 10% bleach, DI water, 70% ethanol, and RNaseZap before and between each sample
- Made 1 ceramic bead tube with 700ul DNA/RNA shield for each tissuelyser sample
- Cut a small piece of tissue for each sample then minced with the razor blade until it was flat and could come apart a little bit and placed in their respective bead homogenization tube
- Ran the tissuelyser for 2 minutes at 25Hz
- Spun down the bead tubes in the minifuge to remove bubbles
- Added 70ul proteinase K digestion buffer and 35ul proteinase K to each bead tube
- Briefly vortexed and spun down sample tubes
- Placed in the thermomixer for 15 minutes shaking at 550rpm at 23 degrees C temp (room temp)
- After homogenization and incubation CPAB2 010:

- After homogenization and incubation CPAB2 005:
![1]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/20201201-1.png "1")
- Removed all the supernatant (~725ul) into new 1.5mL tubes
- Centrifuged tubes for 1 minute at 16,00rcf
- Removed liquid (~725ul) into new 1.5mL tubes avoiding small pellet
- Added equal volume (725ul) DNA/RNA lysis buffer to the 5mL tubes
- Vortexed and spun down tubes

### DNA Extraction

- Flicked and inverted tubes to mix and spun down
- Warmed 10mM Tris HCl pH 8 in the thermomixer at 70 degrees C **note did not warm H2O this time**
- Added 700ul of the liquid to yellow spin columns and collection tubes
- Centrifuged 16,000rcf for 30 seconds
- Saved the flow through in new 5mL tubes
- Repeated addition, centrifugation, and saving of flowthrough for the remaining amount of liquid (3 total spins)
- Added 400ul DNA/RNA prep buffer to the yellow spin columns
- Centrifuged 16,000rcf for 30 seconds
- Discarded flow through (Zymo kit waste)
- Added 700ul DNA/RNA wash buffer to the yellow spin columns
- Centrifuged 16,000rcf for 30 seconds
- Discarded flow through (Zymo kit waste)
- Added 400ul DNA/RNA wash buffer to the yellow spin columns
- Centrifuged 16,000rcf for **2 minutes**
- Transferred spin columns to new 1.5mL tubes for each sample labeled as final DNA tubes
- Discarded flow through and collection tubes
- Added 50ul warmed 10mM Tris HCl to the spin columns gently by dripping over the filter
- Incubated at room temp for 5 minutes
- Centrifuged 16,000rcf for 30 seconds
- Added another 50ul warmed 10mM Tris HCl to the spin columns gently by dripping over the filter
- Incubated at room temp for 5 minutes
- Centrifuged 16,000rcf for 30 seconds
- Discarded the spin columns
- Made strip tubes with 7ul of each sample in them for QC
- Kept tubes on ice bucket then stored in -20 degree freezer

### RNA Extraction

- Added equal volume (1450ul) 100% ethanol to the 5mL tubes of flowthrough
- Vortexed and spun down
- Added 700ul of the liquid to green spin columns and collection tubes
- Centrifuged 16,000rcf for 30 seconds
- Discarded flow through (Zymo kit waste)
- Repeated addition, centrifugation, and saving of flowthrough for the remaining amount of liquid (5 total spins)
-  Added 400ul DNA/RNA wash buffer to the green spin columns
- Centrifuged 16,000rcf for 30 seconds
- Discarded flow through (Zymo kit waste)
- Created the DNase mix:
  - 75ul DNA digestion buffer * 2 = 150ul
  - 5ul DNase I * 2 = 10ul
- Flicked and spun down mix
- Added 80ul DNAse mix to each green spin column filter
- Incubated for 15 minutes at room temp
- Added 400ul DNA/RNA prep buffer to the green spin columns

|Standard 2|20062 RFU|-|-|
|CPAB2 010|25.4|25.2|25.3|
|CPAB2 005|15.3|15.1|15.2|

- RNA

|---|---|---|---|
|Standard 1|399 RFU|-|-|
|Standard 2|8555 RFU|-|-|
|CPAB2 010|too low|-|-|
|CPAB2 005|too low|-|-|


**Decided to combine this CPAB2 005 RA extraction and the CPAB2 RNA extraction from [20201118](https://meschedl.github.io/MES_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/2020-11-18/seastar-rna-1) and vacufuge for 40 minute to concentrate and then re-quantify and do the tapestation**

**Second Qubit**

|Sample|Reading 1 (ng/ul)|Reading 2 (ng/ul)|Average RNA (ng/ul)|
|---|---|---|---|
|Standard 1|396 RFU|-|-|
|Standard 2|8378 RFU|-|-|
|CPAB2 005|13.2|13|13.1|

**Total volume is ~63ul**

#### RNA TapeStation

- Followed [RNA tapestation protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/RNA-TapeStation-Protocol/)
- Kevin ran my 1 sample along with some he had to do: mine is the last sample
