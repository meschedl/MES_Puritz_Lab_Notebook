# DNA/RNA Extractions on 4 Sea Star Tissue Samples Stored in DNA/RNA Shield, 2 Pentagona and 2 Hystera to Nail Down the Right Extraction Protocol

### Notes

- Using the [Zymo DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/quick-dna-rna-kits/products/quick-dna-rna-miniprep-plus-kit)
- Using [these beads](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/bead-tube-2ml-0-5mm-glass-50pk/15340152)
- Re-read the Zymo protocol and they do recommend incubating homogenized tissue for 30 min (although they do not for "tough to lyse samples" or for samples stored in DNA/RNA Shield)
- Plan is to cut small tissue pieces for all samples, mince them with a razor blade, homogenize for 1 minute, then do pro K digestion in the bead tube for 30 minutes

### Sample Preparation

- Samples:
  - CPOI-003
  - CPBP-008
  - CHSY-007
  - CHSB-010
- Thawed samples on ice bucket
- Prepared forceps, foil, and razor blades
- Cleaned forceps with 10% bleach, DI water, 70% ethanol, and RNaseZap before and between each sample
- Made 1 bead tube per sample with 700ul of DNA/RNA shield in each
- Cut a small piece of tissue for each sample then minced with the razor blade until it was flat and could come apart a little bit
- CPOI-003 tissue piece and minced piece

- CPBP-008 tissue piece and minced piece

![4]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CPBP-008-2.jpeg "4")
- CHSY-007 tissue piece and minced piece
![5]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CHSY-007-1.jpeg "5")
![6]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CHSY-007-2.jpeg "6")

![7]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CHSB-010-1.jpeg "7")
![8]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CHSB-010-2.jpeg "8")
- Vortexed the bead tubes for 1 minute at max speed
- Samples looked more broken up than last time!
- CPOI-003
![9]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CPOI-003-3.jpeg "9")
- CPBP-008
![10]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CPBP-008-3.jpeg "10")
- CHSY-007
![11]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CHSY-007-3.jpeg "11")
- CGSB-010
![12]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CHSB-010-3.jpeg "12")
- To keep the tissue in there during the digestion, I decided to do the digestion in the bead tubes
- Added 70ul of Pro K buffer and 35ul of Proteinase K
- Vortexed and spin down tubes
- Placed in the thermomixer at 55 degrees C, shaking at 300rpm (did not want to smash the beads around again but wanted the liquid moving)
- Digested for 30 minutes
- Tubes after digestion looked somewhat better, some more than others
- CPOI-003

![14]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CPBP-008-4.jpeg "14")
- CHSY-007
![15]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CHSY-007-4.jpeg "15")
- CHSB-010
![16]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CHSB-010-4.jpeg "16")

#### Notes

- Better yield this time but still low, at least there is RNA in all the samples!
- Might try mincing more and incubating longer, not sure what else to do
