# Synthesis of EecSeq Probes from Block 10 cDNA Libraries and Hybridization of Probes to DNA Libraries

### Normalization

**Pooling of cDNA libraries, 200ng each**

**Sample**|**μl cDNA**

Total Volume: 64.85μl  
BR Qubit quant of pool: 40.8ng/μl

**DSN Treatment**

- 500ng of pool used for DSN treatment: 12.5μl in a new PCR tube
- Brought up to 13.5μl with 1μl nuclease-free H20
- 4X Hybridization buffer made
- 4.5μl of 4X hybridization buffer added to the tube
- Thermocycler DSN program
- Diluted 10X DSN Master Buffer to 2X
- Put diluted master buffer in 2nd thermocyler at 68 degree hold for 10 min to come up to temp
- Added whole volume of 2X DSN master buffer to the pooled sample in the first thermocycler, pipetted to mix inside the thermocycler
- Waited 10 minutes at 68 degrees C
- Added 2μl of DSN enzyme to pooled sample in first thermocycler, pipetted to mix with p200 pipette
- Waited 25 minutes at 68 degrees C
- Added 40μl DSN stop solution to the tube and pipetted to mix, placed on ice

**Post-DSN Cleanup and PCR**

- Did 1.6X clean up: 128μl KAPA Pure Beads
- Eluted in 25μl 10mM Tris HCl
- 20μl DSN treated library
- Reconstituted and diluted universal i5i7 reamp primers _note, accidentally at first did not dilute properly to 20uM but did 40uM instead which is why even with adding half the volume of primers than usual, the PCR still didn't work great, for the next PCR that was remedied. We though that the amplifications after DSN were not being efficient because of excess primer, so the volume was cut in half and made up by water in the mix_
- PCR reaction for amplification
  - 25μl KAPA ready mix
  - 2.5μl diluted primers
  - 2.5μl nuclease free water
- Placed in thermocycler 14 cycle DSN PCR program
- After: 1.6X cleanup: 80μl KAPA Pure Beads
- Eluted in 22μl 10mM Tris HCl
- Broad Range Qubit: 2.1ng/ul

There is no primer dimer but the concentration is very low, so I decided to split it into 4 replicate tubes and doing 8 cycle PCRs on those (like [the last one](https://meschedl.github.io/MES_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/2019-08-12/B12-Probes))

**Cleanup and PCR**

- Set up 4 PCR tubes with 5μl pooled-treated libs in each, saving 4μl if necessary
- PCR master mix:
  - 52.5μl KAPA ready mix
  - 5.25μl CORRECTLY diluted primers _note: this is half volume, which is probably less than I should have used now that they are diluted properly_
  - 26.46μl nuclease free water
- Thermocycler 8 cycle DSN PCR program
- Pool together 4 tubes after (100μl) and 1.6X cleanup: 160μl KAPA Pure Beads
- Eluted in 40μl 10mM Tris HCl
- Broad Range Qubit: 59ng/μl


### Probe Synthesis

Doing 2 separate digestions each with 1μg and saving the rest. 1μg is 16.8μl, which is more volume than the input for the digestions, but there is also water in the mix that I decided to adjust that volume to make it work.

 **Restriction Digest of Adapters and MBN Treatment**

 - Made 2 PCR tubes each with 16.8μl of pooled-treated libraries (1μg each)
 - Made digest master mix:
    - 8.8μl 10X cutsmart buffer
    - 2.2μl SAII enzyme
    - 41.14μl nuclease free water  

- Added 23.65μl of mastermix to each PCR tube on ice (usually 27.7)
- Theremocycler RE digest short program 4 hours
- Made Mungbean mastermix
  - 9.9μl 10X mungbean buffer
  - 1.1μl mungbean nuclease enzyme  
- Added 5μl of mastermix to each tube in thermocycler then did MBN program 30 min
- Did a 1.5X bead cleanup on each tube: 67.5μl KAPA Pure Beads
- eluted in 21μl 10mM Tris HCl
- Did another 1.5X bead cleanup on each tube: 31.5μl KAPA Pure Beads
- Eluted in 22μl 10mM Tris HCl and placed in fridge overnight

D5000 Tapestation the next day [results](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1OMD_6Kv_ZtO1ucrvo_WaPm8mCOYGOpXA) look right, no left over adapters, and the size has shifted smaller with the loss of the adapters, looks good to go forward for 2 biotin labelings.

 - 22μl 5X decanucleotide reaction buffer
 - 30.8μl nuclease free water
- Added 24μl of mix to 2 PCR tubes
- Added 20μl of DSN-RE-MBN treated pooled libraries, one for each tube

- Make biotin labeling mastermix:
  - 11μl biotin labeling mix
  - 2.2 klenow fragment
- Added 6μl of biotin labeling master mix to each of the 4 tubes
- Shook tubes and spun down, continued program ~20 hours, done at 7:30am
- Pooled all samples together for 1.5X cleanup: 150μl KAPA pure beads
- Eluted in 50μl 10mM Tris HCl pH 8
- Qubit: 50ng/μl

D5000 Tapestation [results](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1OMD_6Kv_ZtO1ucrvo_WaPm8mCOYGOpXA) looks normal!

### Prep and Hybridization


#### Pooling of DNA Libraries

- Pool 200ng of each DNA library, add 500ng of probes, then add water to equal up to 23.5μl total volume
- Probes quant is 50ng/μl, so 500ng is 10μl
- 3 captures this time

**Capture 1**

|---|---|
|T0S1|2.99μl|
|T0S4|1.49μl|
|T24J1|1.17μl|
|T24J2|1.74μl|
|T24J3|1.21μl|
|T24J5|1.23μl|
|**Total**|**9.83μl**|


**Capture 2**

|T24J11|1.21μl|
|T24J12|1.42μl|
|T24J13|1.2μl|
|**Total**|**7.47μl**|



- **10μl of block 10 probes were added to each capture pool**
- The volume of nuclease free water needed to add up to 23.5μl total volume in each capture pool was calculated then added:

|Sample|vol pool w/probes|vol H20|
|---|---|---|
|Cap 1|19.83μl|3.67μl|
|Cap 2|18.59μl|4.91μl|
