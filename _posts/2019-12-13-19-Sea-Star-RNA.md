# Extraction RNA and Stranded mRNA Library Prep for Pentagona and Hystera Sea Stars for Use in Genome Building

### RNA Extraction

Used [Zymo Research Quick DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/quick-dna-rna-kits) for extraction (probably should just have used the RNA one) and the [Zymo bashing beads](https://www.zymoresearch.com/products/zr-bashingbead-lysis-tubes-0-1-0-5-mm) for homogenization. Roughly followed [Emma Strand's Soft Homogenization Protocol](https://github.com/emmastrand/EmmaStrand_Notebook/blob/master/_posts/2019-06-05-Soft-and-Hard-Homogenization-Protocol.md) for ideas on how to homogenize samples because I'd never worked with sea stars before and Emma consistently gets good RNA with her protocol. Additionally I looked at [this version of Mo'orea coral extractions](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/Eggs-Bundles-Moorea/) which was the only time when I got good RNA out of those samples, and they are also tissue preserved in DNA/RNA shield, so that is why I had no incubation step.

1. Took out 1 P6 and 1 H6 sample (tissue in DNA/RNA shield) and thawed on ice
2. Filled two ZR bashing bead tubes with 700μl DNA/RNA Shield and named the tubes PA and HA
3. Sterilized foil, scalpel, foil, and forceps. Took sample out of tube and cut in half on foil. Placed one half in the new bashing bead tube
4. Vortexed each sample for 1 minute max speed
5. Let sit after votexing: very bubbly. _HA liquid was a lot more orange than PA. There was still a pretty prominent ossicle chunk left in there_
6. Aspirated all liquid I could get off into new labeled 1.5mL tubes
7. Took 300μl of that into new 1.5mL tubes going forward
8. Added 30μl prok digestion buffer
9. Added 15μl Pro K
10. Vortexed and spun down tubes


11. Equal volumes of DNA/RNA Lysis Buffer were added to each sample tube: 345μl
12. Mixed samples by flicking and spinning down
13. ~700µl of sample was gently added to Yellow DNA spin columns
14. Centrifuged columns at 16000 rcf for 30 seconds
15. Flow-through was transferred to new 1.5 mL tubes for RNA
8. Added 400µl DNA/RNA Prep Buffer gently to the yellow DNA spin columns
9. Centrifuged at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
10. Discarded flow through (Zymo kit waste)
11. Added 700µl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer gently to the yellow DNA spin columns
12. Centrifuged at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
13. Discarded flow through (Zymo kit waste)
14. Added 400µl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer genetly to the yellow DNA spin columns
15. Centrifuged at 16,000 rcf (g) for **2 minutes**
16. Discarded flow through (Zymo kit waste)
17. Transferred yellow columns to new 1.5mL microcentrifuge tubes
18. Add 50µl warmed 10mM Tris HCl to each yellow DNA column
19. Incubated at room temp for 5 minutes
20. Centrifuged at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
21. Repeated last three steps for a final elution volume of 100µl


30. Added equal volume  100% EtOH to the 1.5mL tubes labeled for RNA containing the original yellow column flow through: ~700µl
31. Vortexed and spin down to mix
25. Added 700µl of that liquid to the green RNA spin columns
26. Centrifuged at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
27. Discarded flow through (Zymo kit waste)
28. Added 700µl to the green RNA spin columns (the rest from the 1.5mL RNA tubes)
29. Centrifuged at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
30. Discarded flow through (Zymo kit waste)
31. Added 400µl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer gently to each green RNA column
32. Centrifuged at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
33. Discarded flow through (Zymo kit waste)
34. Made DNase I treatment master mix:
    - 75µl DNA Digestion buffer x 2 = 150µl
    - 5µl DNase I x 2 = 10µl
35. Added 80µl DNase I treatment master mix directly to the filter of the green RNA columns
36. Incubated at room temp for 15 minutes
37. Added 400µl DNA/RNA Prep Buffer gently to each column
38. Centrifuged at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
39. Discarded flow through (Zymo kit waste)
40. Added 700µl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer gently to the yellow DNA spin columns
41. Centrifuged at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
42. Discarded flow through (Zymo kit waste)
43. Added 400µl DNA/RNA Wash Buffer genetly to the yellow DNA spin columns
44. Centrifuged at 16,000 rcf (g) for **2 minutes**
45. Discarded flow through (Zymo kit waste)
46. Transferred green columns to new 1.5mL microcentrifuge tubes
47. Added 50µl warmed DNase/RNase free water to each green RNA column by dripping slowly directly on the filer
48. Incubated at room temp for 5 minutes
49. Centrifuged at 16,000 rcf (g) for 30 seconds
50. ed last three steps for a final elution volume of 100µl
51. Labeled 1.5mL tubes on ice afterwards, and aliquoted 5µl into PCR strip tubes to save for Qubit and Tape Station to avoid freeze-thaw
52. Stored all tubes in the -80
