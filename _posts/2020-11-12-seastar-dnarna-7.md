# DNA/RNA Extractions on 3 Sea Star Tissue Samples Stored in DNA/RNA Shield, 2 Pentagona and 1 Hystera, Using the Tissuelyser for 1 Minute at 15Hz and Incubating at Room Temperature for 15 Minutes


### Notes

- Using the [Zymo DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/quick-dna-rna-kits/products/quick-dna-rna-miniprep-plus-kit)
- Used 1.4mm ceramic beads and the tissuelyser for 1 minute at 15Hz, stopped at 30 seconds and moved the tubes to the other side of the sample holder in the lyser.
- Incubated at room temp with the proteinase K for 15 minutes shaking at 55rpm

## Sample Preparation

- Samples:
  - CPBP-008
  - CPAB-001
  - CHSB-004
- Thawed samples on ice bucket
- Prepared forceps, foil, and razor blades
- Cleaned forceps with 10% bleach, DI water, 70% ethanol, and RNaseZap before and between each sample
- Made 1 ceramic bead tube with 800ul DNA/RNA shield for each tissuelyser sample (as per the updated kit recomendations)
- Cut a small piece of tissue for each sample then minced with the razor blade until it was flat and could come apart a little bit and placed in their respective bead homogenization tube
- CPBP-008 tissue piece and minced piece

- Bead tubes before tissuelyser homogenization:
![7]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/20201112-pre-TL.jpeg "7")
- Put bead tubes in the tissuelyser for 30 seconds at 15Hz
- Orientation of bead tubes in holders:
![8]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/20201112-TL1.jpeg "8")
- After 30 seconds, changed orientation of bead tubes in holders:

![10]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/20201112-TL3.jpeg "10")
- Ran the tissuelyser again for 30 seconds at 15Hz
- Spun down the bead tubes in the minifuge to remove bubbles
- After homogenization:
![11]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/20201112-post-TL.jpeg "11")
- Added 80ul proteinase K digestion buffer and 40ul proteinase K to each bead tube
- Briefly vortexed and spun down sample tubes
- Placed in the thermomixer for 10 minutes shaking at 550rpm at 22 degrees C temp (room temp)
- At 10 minutes checked on the status of the tissue:
![12]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/20201112-10min.jpeg "12")
- Saw still some tissue so decided to go to 15 minutes
- Status of tissue at 15 minutes:
![13]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/20201112-15min.jpeg "13")
- Tissue looked pretty broken down, hard to tell if it was just in between the beads
- Removed all the supernatant (~830ul) into new 1.5mL tubes
- Centrifuged tubes for 1 minute at 16,00rcf
- Noticed pellet after centrifugation:
![14]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/20201112-pellet.jpeg "14")
- Removed liquid (~830ul) into new 5mL tubes
- Added equal volume (830ul) DNA/RNA lysis buffer to the 5mL tubes
- Vortexed and spun down tubes

### DNA Extraction
