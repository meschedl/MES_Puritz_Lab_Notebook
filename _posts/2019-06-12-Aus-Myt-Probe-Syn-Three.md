### Second day of Stranded mRNA Seq Library Prep
_All steps in are done side by side with [Amy Zyck](https://github.com/amaeliazyck), continuing with sample tubes AL, FR, and MN, and Amy with TZ and RI_

Following half reactions from the [KAPA Biosystems Stranded mRNA-Seq Kit](https://www.kapabiosystems.com/product-applications/products/next-generation-sequencing-2/rna-library-preparation-2/kapa-stranded-mrna-seq-kits/#accordion-order), also see the [EeqSeq protocol](https://github.com/jpuritz/EecSeq/blob/master/Protocol.md#stranded-mrna-seq-library-prep)

**A-tailing and Ligation**

1. Made A-tailing after safe stopping point master mix:  
  `5.25μl nuclease-free water * 5.2 = 27.3μl`  
  `0.75μl A-tailing buffer * 5.2 = 3.9μl`  
  `1.5μl A-tailing enzyme * 5.2 = 7.8μl`
2. Took sample tubes out of the 4 degree and added 7.5μl of the A-tailing after safe stopping point master mix to each tube and pipetted to mix  
3. Put tubes in the thermocycler A-tailing program
4. Made the Adapter Ligation Master Mix:  
  `8μl nuclease-free water * 5.2 = 41.6μl`  
  `7μl ligation buffer * 5.2 = 36.4μl`  
  `2.5μl DNA ligase * 5.2 = 13μl`  
5. Added 17.5μl of the ligation master mix to each tube
6. Added 2.5μl of the appropriate diluted working stock adapter to each tube:  
    - AL - SAII
    - FR - NCO
    - MN - NCO
    - TZ - SAII
    - RI - NCO
7. Pipetted to mix
8. Put tubes in the thermomixer with the 96 well plate adapter so the tubes could be shaken at 300 speed and 20C for 1 hour of adapter ligation
10. Added 35μl of room temperature PEG to each sample and pipetted to mix
11. Placed on shaker for 15 minutes
12. Made fresh 80% EtOH
13. Placed tubes on magnet plate
14. Removed 67μl of supernatant from each tube
15. Added 100μl 80% EtOH to each tube  
16. Removed 100μl of supernatant from each tube
17.  Added 100μl 80% EtOH to each tube  
18. Removed ALL of the supernatant from each tube, using a p20 pipette tip to get rid of droplets
19. Resuspended beads in 25μl of 10mM Tris HCl pH 8
20. Placed tubes on shaker for 5 minutes
21. Added 25μl of room temperature PEG to each tube and pipetted to mix
22. Placed on shaker for 15 minutes
23. Made fresh 80% EtOH
24. Placed tubes on magnet plate
25. Removed 67μl of supernatant from each tube
26. Added 100μl 80% EtOH to each tube  
27. Removed 100μl of supernatant from each tube
28. Added 100μl 80% EtOH to each tube  
29. Removed ALL of the supernatant from each tube, using a p20 pipette tip to get rid of droplets
30. Resuspended beads in 11μl of 10mM Tris HCl pH 8
31. Placed tubes on shaker for 5 minutes
32. Placed tubes on magnet stand and removed 10μl of clear supernatant to new tubes
33. Placed tubes in 4 degree overnight
