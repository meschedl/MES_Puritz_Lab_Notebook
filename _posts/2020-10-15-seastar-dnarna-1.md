# DNA/RNA Extractions on 8 Sea Star Tissue Samples Stored in DNA/RNA Shield

### Notes

- Followed [this extraction notebook post](https://meschedl.github.io/MES_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/2019-12-13/19-Sea-Star-RNA) closely
- Had a different type of [bead tube](https://www.fishersci.com/shop/products/bead-tube-2ml-0-5mm-glass-50pk/15340152)
- Using the [Zymo DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/quick-dna-rna-kits/products/quick-dna-rna-miniprep-plus-kit)

### Sample Preparation

- Samples:
  - CPAB-003
  - CHSB-005
  - CPBO-008
  - CPOI-009
  - CPAB-011
  - CPDB-001
  - CPBP-001
  - CHSY-010
- Thawed samples on ice bucket
- Prepared forceps, foil, and razor blades
- Cleaned forceps with 10% bleach, DI water, 70% ethanol, and RNaseZap before and between each sample
- Made 1 bead tube per sample with 700ul of DNA/RNA shield in each
- Cut each tissue piece in half and placed in the bead tube
- CPAB-003

![7]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CPBP-001.jpeg "7")
- CHSY-010
![8]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CHSY-010.jpeg "8")
- Vortexed the bead tubes for 1 minute at max speed
- The tissue didn't look that broken up but I continued with the protocol that I had tired previously
- Spun down the tubes to remove bubbles (there were still some)
- Removed all the volume I could from the bead tubes into new 1.5mL tubes ~450ul
- Saved the bead tubes by adding 300ul DNA/RNA Shield to each and freezing them. They looked like:

#### 1% Agarose Gel for DNA Quality

- Followed [gel protocol](https://github.com/meschedl/PPP-Lab-Resources/blob/master/Protocols/Agrose-Gel-Protocol.md)
![10]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/gel20201015.jpeg "10")

#### RNA TapeStation

- Followed [RNA tapestation protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/RNA-TapeStation-Protocol/)
- Only TapeStationed CPAB-003 and CPBP-001
- [Results link](https://github.com/meschedl/MES_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/tapetstations/2020-10-15%20-%2016.26.49.pdf)

#### Notes

- Quality of DNA and RNA is good but yield is LOW especially of the RNA
- I think the homogenization was not efficient and also the small sample pieces need the most efficient
- Next extraction I will try to chop the pieces before homogenization and maybe add incubation too
