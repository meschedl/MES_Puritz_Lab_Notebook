# DNA/RNA Extractions on 3 Sea Star Tissue Samples Stored in DNA/RNA Shield, 2 Pentagona and 1 Hystera Homogenizing Using Dremel

### Notes

- Using the [Zymo DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/quick-dna-rna-kits/products/quick-dna-rna-miniprep-plus-kit)
- Used Dremel with drill bit head for 30 seconds at lowest power setting (5)
- Incubated for 30 minutes afterwards with proK

## Sample Preparation

- Samples:
  - CPAB1-011
  - CPOI-004
  - CHSY-001
- Thawed samples on ice bucket
- Prepared forceps, foil, and razor blades
- Cleaned forceps with 10% bleach, DI water, 70% ethanol, and RNaseZap before and between each sample
- Cleaned dremel bit by bathing in beach, DI and ethanol and touching only with forceps between each sample
- Made 1 1.5mL tube per sample with 300ul of DNA/RNA shield in each
- Cut a small piece of tissue for each sample then minced with the razor blade until it was flat and could come apart a little bit and placed in tube with shield
- CPAB1-011 tissue piece and minced piece

![2]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CPAB1-011-2.jpeg "2")
- CPOI-004 tissue piece and minced piece
![3]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CPOI-004-1.jpeg "3")
![4]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CPOI-004-2.jpeg "4")
- CHSY-001 tissue piece and minced piece
![5]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CHSY-001-1.jpeg "5")
![6]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CHSY-001-2.jpeg "6")
- CPAB1-011 was homogenized with the dremel first, I went in 10 second increments at 5 speed
- Before homogenization

- 10 seconds:

- 20 seconds:

- 30 seconds:
![9]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CPAB1-011-6.jpeg "9")
- I stopped at 30 seconds because it didn't look really any more mixed than 20 seconds and I wondered if going longer would mess up the quality of the DNA
- CPOI-004 before and after 30 seconds of dremel homogenization at 5 speed:
![3]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CPOI-004-3.jpeg "3")
![4]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CPOI-004-4.jpeg "4")
- CHSY-001 before and after 30 seconds of dremel homogenization at 5 speed:
![5]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CHSY-001-3.jpeg "5")
![6]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/CHSY-001-4.jpeg "6")
- Added 30ul prok digestion buffer and 15ul proK
- Vortexed and spun down tubes
- Incubated tubes at 55 degrees C for 30 minutes shaking at 500rpm in the thermomixer
- Tubes after incubation:
![6]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/20201102.jpeg "6")
- Centrifuged tubes for 2 minutes at maximum speed to pellet debris
- Pipetted ~320ul of supernatant into new 1.5mL tubes
- Interestingly, here not all the tissue had pelleted, some was floating, I centrifuged the 2 samples again for 2 min at max speed but it did not help. I have never seen that before:

#### Notes

RNA is not good quality, but also not completely degraded.
