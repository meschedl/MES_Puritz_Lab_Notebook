# DNA Extractions of 10 Hystera and Pentagona With the [Zymo Research Quick-DNA Miniprep Plus Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/quick-dna-kits/products/quick-dna-miniprep-plus-kit)

**Notes: followed kit recommendations for samples stored in DNA/RNA Shield and used and intermediate incubation time of 2 hours**

## Sample Preparation and Digestion

- Samples:
  - CHSB-004
  - CHSB-006
  - CHSY-004
  - CHSY-010
  - CPAB2-001
  - CPAB2-006
  - CPAB2-007
  - CPDB-005
  - CPDB-006
  - CPAB-007
- Thawed samples on ice bucket
- Prepared forceps, foil, and razor blades
- Cleaned with 10% bleach, DI water, and 70% ethanol before and between each sample
- Prepared a 1.5mL tube for each sample with 300ul DNA/RNA shield in each
- Cut a small piece of tissue for each sample then minced with the razor blade until it was flat and could come apart a little bit and placed in their respective 1.5mL tube
- Added 150ul of the blue solid tissue buffer to each sample processing tube
- Added 10ul of proteinase K enzyme to each sample processing tube
- Vortexed and spun down tubes
- Placed tubes in the thermomixer at 55 degrees C for 2 hours shaking at 1200rpm
- Placed all sample tubes in the tabletop centrifuge and spun at 16,000rcf for 1 minute
- Removed ~450ul of supernatant into new 1.5mL tubes
- Added 450ul of Genomic DNA Binding Buffer to each new tube
- Vortexed and spun down tubes

## DNA Extraction

- Set up 1 spin column and collection tube per sample
- Warmed 10mM Tris HCl to 70 degrees C in the thermomixer
- Added 700ul of each sample to their labeled spin columns
- Centrifuged at 16000 rcf for 1 min
- Discarded flow through
- Added the rest of the liquid to the spin columns and centrifuged in the same way
- Transferred columns to new collection tubes
- Added 400ul DNA pre-wash buffer to each column
- Centrifuged 16000 rcf for 1 minute and discarded flow through
- Added 700ul g-DNA wash buffer to each column
- Centrifuged 16000 rcf for 1 minute and discarded flow through
- Added 200ul g-DNA wash buffer to each column
- Centrifuged 16000 rcf for 1 minute and discarded flow through
- Made 1.5mL tubes labeled completely with sample names and information
- Transferred spin columns to those 1.5mL tubes
- Added 50ul of warmed 10mM tris HCl by dripping to each spin column filter
- Incubated columns for 5 minutes
- Centrifuged columns for 1 min at 16000 rcf
- Repeated last 3 steps once
- Placed tubes on ice afterwards

**Qubit**

- Broad range dsDNA qubit ([protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MES_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/2019-03-02/Qubit-Protocol))
- Amounts are in ng/ul and samples were read twice
