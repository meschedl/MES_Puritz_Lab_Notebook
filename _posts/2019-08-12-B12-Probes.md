Total Volume: 40.53μl  
BR Qubit quant of pool: 82.8ng/μl

**DSN Treatment**

- 500ng of pool used for DSN treatment: 6.04μl in a new PCR tube
- Brought up to 13.5μl with 7.96μl nuclease-free H20
- 4X Hybridization buffer made
- 4.5μl of 4X hybridization buffer added to the tube
- Thermocycler DSN program
- Diluted 10X DSN Master Buffer to 2X
- Put diluted master buffer in 2nd thermocyler at 68 degree hold for 10 min to come up to temp
- Added whole volume of 2X DSN master buffer to the pooled sample in the first thermocycler, pipetted to mix inside the thermocycler
- Waited 10 minutes at 68 degrees C
- Added 2μl of DSN enzyme to pooled sample in first thermocycler, pipetted to mix with p200 pipette
- Waited 25 minutes at 68 degrees C
- Added 40μl DSN stop solution to the tube and pipetted to mix, placed on ice

**Post-DSN**

- Did 1.6X clean up: 128μl KAPA Pure Beads
- Eluted in 25μl 10mM Tris HCl
- High Sensitivity Qubit: 1.11ng/μl

**Post-DSN PCR**

- 20μl DSN treated library
- 25μl KAPA ready mix
- 5μl KAPA library amp primer mix


- Placed in thermocycler 14 cycle DSN PCR program
- After: 1.6X cleanup: 80μl KAPA Pure Beads
- Eluted in 22μl 10mM Tris HCl
- Broad Range Qubit: 5.45ng/ul

Seems like PCR didn't really work, but this has happened before. Wanted to check the tapestation to make sure nothing is weird.

Looks mostly right, except there is primer dimer in there so I decided to do another bead cleanup before splitting it into 4 replicate tubes and doing 8 cycle PCRs on those

**Cleanup and PCR**

- 1.6X cleanup so 32μl KAPA Pure Beads
- Eluted in 24μl 10mM Tris HCl
- Set up 4 PCR tubes with 5μl pooled-treated libs in each, saving 4μl if necessary
- PCR master mix:
  - 52.5μl KAPA ready mix
  - 10.5μl KAPA lib amp primers
  - 21μl nuclease free water
- Thermocycler 8 cycle DSN PCR program
- Pool together 4 tubes after (100μl) and 1.6X cleanup: 160μl KAPA Pure Beads
- Eluted in 40μl 10mM Tris HCl
- Broad Range Qubit: 132.5ng/μl!!


#### Probe Synthesis

Saving 1μg of probes and doing 4 separate digestions each with 1μg. I have enough for that.

 **Restriction Digest of Adapters and MBN Treatment**

 - Made 4 PCR tubes with 7.55μl of pooled-treated libraries (1μg each)
 - Brought up to 12.25μl with 7.7μl nuclease free water
 - Made digest master mix:
    - 16.4μl 10X cutsmart buffer
    - 4.1μl SAII enzyme
    - 93.28μl nuclease free water  

- Added 27.7μl of mastermix to each PCR tube on ice
- Theremocycler RE digest short program 4 hours
- Made Mungbean mastermix
  - 18.9μl 10X mungbean buffer
  - 2.1μl mungbean nuclease enzyme  
- Added 5μl of mastermix to each tube in thermocycler then did MBN program 30 min
- Did a 1.5X bead cleanup on each tube: 67.5μl KAPA Pure Beads
- eluted in 21μl 10mM Tris HCl
- Did another 1.5X bead cleanup on each tube: 31.5μl KAPA Pure Beads
- Eluted in 22μl 10mM Tris HCl

D5000 Tapestation [results](https://github.com/meschedl/MES_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/tapetstations/post-DSN-RE-MBN.pdf) look right, no left over adapters

**Biotin Labeling**

- Made biotin mastermix:
 - 42μl 5X decanucleotide reaction buffer
 - 58.8μl nuclease free water
- Added 24μl of mix to 4 PCR tubes
- Added 20μl of DSN-RE-MBN treated pooled libraries to each tube
- Put in thermocycler DSN program
- Make biotin labeling mastermix:
  - 21μl biotin labeling mix
  - 4.2 klenow fragment
- Added 6μl of biotin labeling master mix to each of the 4 tubes
- Shook tubes and spun down, continued program ~20 hours
- Pooled all samples together for 1.5X cleanup: 300μl KAPA pure beads
- Eluted in 50μl 10mM Tris HCl pH 8
- Qubit: 92.8ng/μl!!

D5000 Tapestation [results](https://github.com/meschedl/MES_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/tapetstations/biotinylated-probes.pdf) look normal to me! Still not sure why it trails off so much
