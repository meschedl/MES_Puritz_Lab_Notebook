# RNA Extractions of 3 Hystera and 3 Pentagona With the [Zymo DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/quick-dna-rna-kits/products/quick-dna-rna-miniprep-plus-kit)

### Notes

- Using the [Zymo DNA/RNA Miniprep Plus kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/quick-dna-rna-kits/products/quick-dna-rna-miniprep-plus-kit)
- Used 1.4mm ceramic beads and the tissuelyser for 2 minutes at 25Hz, stopped at 30 seconds and moved the tubes to the other side of the sample holder in the lyser.
- Incubated at room temp with the proteinase K for 15 minutes shaking at 550rpm


## Sample Preparation

- Samples:
  - CHSB-002
  - CHSB-003
  - CHSY-003
  - CPAB2-005
  - CPAB2-009
  - CPOI-008
- Thawed samples on ice bucket
- Prepared forceps, foil, and razor blades
- Cleaned forceps with 10% bleach, DI water, 70% ethanol, and RNaseZap before and between each sample
- Made 1 ceramic bead tube with 800ul DNA/RNA shield for each tissuelyser sample
- Cut a small piece of tissue for each sample then minced with the razor blade until it was flat and could come apart a little bit and placed in their respective bead homogenization tube
- Ran the tissuelyser for 2 minutes at 25Hz
- Spun down the bead tubes in the minifuge to remove bubbles
- Added 80ul proteinase K digestion buffer and 40ul proteinase K to each bead tube
- Briefly vortexed and spun down sample tubes
- Placed in the thermomixer for 15 minutes shaking at 550rpm at 23 degrees C temp (room temp)
- After homogenization and incubation CHSB-002:

#### RNA TapeStation

- Followed [RNA tapestation protocol](https://meschedl.github.io/MESPutnam_Open_Lab_Notebook/RNA-TapeStation-Protocol/)
- [TapeStation Report link](https://github.com/meschedl/MES_Puritz_Lab_Notebook/blob/master/tapetstations/2020-11-18%20-%2015.30.56.pdf)
- I ended up tapestationing all the samples because I thought there was some RNA  in the CPAB2 samples, it could just be too low for the Qubit to read. Turns out I was right. I also looked up the [Quant-IT RNA assay guide](https://www.thermofisher.com/document-connect/document-connect.html?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.thermofisher.com%2FTFS-Assets%2FLSG%2Fmanuals%2FQuant_iT_RNA_Assay_UG.pdf&title=VXNlciBHdWlkZTogUXVhbnQtaVQgUk5BIEFzc2F5IEtpdA==) and it's not supposed to quantify below 5ng (that's 5ng/ul), but this kit is made to use in the plate reader, so my guess is that it's a little off using the Qubit and can't read below 10ng/ul
