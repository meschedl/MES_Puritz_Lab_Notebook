# DNA Extractions of 16 Hystera and Pentagona With the [Zymo Research Quick-DNA Miniprep Plus Kit](https://www.zymoresearch.com/collections/quick-dna-kits/products/quick-dna-miniprep-plus-kit)

**Notes: followed kit recommendations for samples stored in DNA/RNA Shield and used and intermediate incubation time of 2 hours**

## Sample Preparation and Digestion

- Samples:
  - COPI-010
  - CPOI-009
  - CPOI-005
  - CPOI-001
  - CPBP-007
  - CPBP-005
  - CPBP-004
  - CPBO-008
  - CPBO-004
  - CPAB-010
  - CPAB-006
  - CPAB-002
  - CPDB-007
  - CPDB-004
  - CHSY-008
  - CHSY-009
- Thawed samples on ice bucket
- Prepared forceps, foil, and razor blades
- Cleaned with 10% bleach, DI water, and 70% ethanol before and between each sample
- Prepared a 1.5mL tube for each sample with 300ul DNA/RNA shield in each
- Cut a small piece of tissue for each sample then minced with the razor blade until it was flat and could come apart a little bit and placed in their respective 1.5mL tube _note sample CPBO 008 did not have tissue, it looked like it had broken up completely into the liquid so I added 200ul of the liquid to the extraction tube_
- Added 150ul of the blue solid tissue buffer to each sample processing tube
- Added 10ul of proteinase K enzyme to each sample processing tube
- Vortexed and spun down tubes
- Placed tubes in the thermomixer at 55 degrees C for 2 hours shaking at 1200rpm
- Placed all sample tubes in the tabletop centrifuge and spun at 16,000rcf for 1 minute
- Removed ~450ul of supernatant into new 1.5mL tubes _note, sample CPBO 008 looks like it lost liquid during incubation because less than 400ul were present_
- Added 450ul of Genomic DNA Binding Buffer to each new tube
- Vortexed and spun down tubes

## DNA Extraction

- Set up 1 spin column and collection tube per sample
- Warmed 10mM Tris HCl to 70 degrees C in the thermomixer
- Added 700ul of each sample to their labeled spin columns
- Centrifuged at 16000 rcf for 1 min
- Discarded flow through
- Added the rest of the liquid to the spin columns and centrifuged in the same way
- Transferred columns to new collection tubes
- Added 400ul DNA pre-wash buffer to each column
- Centrifuged 16000 rcf for 1 minute and discarded flow through
- Added 700ul g-DNA wash buffer to each column
- Centrifuged 16000 rcf for 1 minute and discarded flow through
- Added 200ul g-DNA wash buffer to each column
- Centrifuged 16000 rcf for 1 minute and discarded flow through
- Made 1.5mL tubes labeled completely with sample names and information
- Transferred spin columns to those 1.5mL tubes
- Added 50ul of warmed 10mM tris HCl by dripping to each spin column filter
- Incubated columns for 5 minutes
- Centrifuged columns for 1 min at 16000 rcf
- Repeated last 3 steps once
- Placed tubes on ice afterwards
