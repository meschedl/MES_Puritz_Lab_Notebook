tags: [ protocol, DNA, gel ]

#### This protocol is for the Putnam, Prada, and Puritz Labs

1.	For small gel box, make a 100mL gel mix.
2.	For 1% gel use 100mL 1X TAE buffer and 1g Agarose, for a 1.5% gel use 1.5g Agarose, for a 2% gel use 2g agarose
3.	Use a weigh boat to measure agarose and using the Erlenmeyer flask to measure the TAE
4.	Mix in an Erlenmeyer flask, to do this you add half of the TAE buffer volume needed, add the agarose, then add the rest of the TAE. Avoid getting agarose stuck on the sides of the flask. Swirl to mix
5.	 Put a scrunched Kimwipe in the mouth of the flask and put in the microwave for 1 minute. Every 20 seconds open microwave and swirl flask. Use glove because glass gets hot and don’t be afraid to check too often because it can boil over
6.	Microwaving time can vary, so keep adding time until when you look at the liquid when swirling it is completely clear and there are no “flakes”
7.	Add 5μl GelRed to the liquid, mix with the pipette tip and swirl the flask to mix thoroughly.
8.	Set up gel cast mold, place small tray in the gel box sideways and make sure there is an air-tight seal with the rubber noodles
9.	Let gel cool ~5 minutes in the flask before pouring into the gel tray, _only pour 75% of the liquid into the mold as to not make too thick a gel_
10.	Put desired comb size into the tray
11.	Using a pipette tip, move any bubbles to the side of the tray
12.	Let harden until opaque and cool ~30min
13.	Take out and orient the gel with the comb side to the top of the box. Take the comb out of the hardened gel
14.	Pour enough “used” TAE buffer into the gel box to cover the gel with a thin layer of liquid
15.	In a new strip tube, make 5μl aliquots of your DNA samples. Add 1μl of loading dye to each sample and vortex and spin down to mix
16.	Add 3-4μl of the appropriate ladder to the first well in the gel
17.	Add your samples to each well ~6μl. Make sure you have made a map in your notebook that shows the order of samples
18.	Make sure gel is set up to “run towards red”
19.	Plug black cable into black insert and red cable into red insert of the gel box
20.	Turn box on and make sure voltage is set to 100V. Set time for 30-60min or press start and come back.
21.	Once done, take the tray out of the boxy and using a Kimwipe, slide the gel into your hands. Bring over to the imaging plate and set in the center of the blue square
22.	Place the orange shield over the gel
23.	Take a cardboard box with a hole cut in it and put it over the light imager
24.	Turn on the imager and using your phone take a picture of the gel through the box, turning off the lab lights helps
25.	Slide the gel off when you are done and place it in the large plastic jar in the SAA for gel waste. Alternatively you can cut out and save the part of the gel you didn’t use if you didn’t need all the wells/both combs
26.	Pour the leftover TAE in the gel box into the used TAE container
27.	Rinse the gel box, comb, and flask in DI type II water
28.	Wipe the imager with a Kimwipe and DI type II water

29. An extra step can be to annotate your gel image ex:

This can easily be done in something as simple as google slides
