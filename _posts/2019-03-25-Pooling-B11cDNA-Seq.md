title: Pooling CASE Block 11 cDNA Libraries for Sequencing
tags: [ oyster larvae, RNA, cDNA, sequencing ]

### Pooling CASE Block 11 larval oyster cDNA from mRNA Libraries of T24 samples (made in November) for sequencing with Novogene company.

**Quants of libraries were calculated from the TapeStation traces by correcting the peak to be between 250 and 600 base pairs and using that concentration (ng/µl)**

There are 16 libraries made, and we are pooling into 8 based on index combinations. Index 1 and 2 are paired in individual samples to eliminate the possibility of index hopping. There are two samples per every paired index, each with a different adapter barcode, and we are pooling by the same index pairs.

Each pool should contain 200ng of library from each sample, and enough 10mM Tris-HCl to add up to 10µl in a screw cap 2mL tube. Tubes were vortexed, spun down, parafilmed on the lid, and shipped with dry ice.
